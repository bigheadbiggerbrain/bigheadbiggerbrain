- 👋 Hi, I’m Josemi, most known as @bigheadbiggerbrain. I'm 16 years old, and I'm from Málaga (Spain).
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Data Visualization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and soon I will start with Python for Data Science and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to improve my coding and data skills because I love coding, but sometimes it is a bit complicated for me. I'm looking also to collaborate on interesting projects with new people and make new friends all around the world.
- 📫 You can reach me by sending me an e-mail to bigheadbiggerbrain@gmail.com or by Twitter (@bigheadnbrain).
